Description: Perform the Adaptable Regularized Hotelling's T^2 test (ARHT) proposed by
    Li et al., arXiv:1609.08725. Both one-sample and two-sample mean test are available with
    various probabilistic alternative prior models. It contains a function to consistently
    estimate higher order moments of the population covariance spectral distribution using
    the spectral of the sample covariance matrix (Bai et al. (2010)). In addition, it contains
    a function to sample from 3-variate chi-squared random vectors approximately with a given
    correlation matrix when the degrees of freedom are large.
